This directory contains a Gauche interface to Mersenne Twister pseudo-
random generator.  Mersenne Twister algorithm is developed by Makoto
Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura.  It is fast, has higher order of
equidistribution, and has the period of 2^19937-1.
See http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html for details.

This implementation is derived from the 2002/1/26 version of mt19937ar,
