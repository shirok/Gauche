/* CompactTrie is a structure to store data indexed by full 32bit integer.
 * It can be used as a space-efficient vector and as a back-end of sparse
 * hash table.  Compact Trie itself is *not* an ScmObj.
 *
 * CompactTrie is not intended to be used outside of ext/sparse source tree,
 * hence we don't use 'Scm' prefix for data structures, for simplicity.
 */

/* CompactTrie consists of NODEs and LEAFs.  LEAF is application-dependent
 * structure whose header contains the key value that uniquely identifies
 * the leaf.
 * NODE is a variable length structure, whose first two words are bitmaps.
 * (NB: we may change the layout here, since full-word bitmap tends to become
 * false pointer and may have negative impact to our conservative GC.)
 *
 * NODE represents 32-way branch.  The first bitmap, EMAP or entry map,
 * shows which logical index of this node is active.  The second bitmap,
 * LMAP, shows which entry of logical index of this node is LEAF.
 * LMAP is always a strict subset of EMAP.   If bit N of EMAP is 1 and
 * bit N of LMAP is 0, the N-th index points to the child node.
 *
 * Suppose EMAP is 0x00001809 and LMAP is 0x00001008.   It means this
 * node has entries in index 0, 3, 11, 12.  Entry #0 and #11 points to
 * child NODEs, and entry #3 and #12 are LEAFs.
 *
 * The actual entries follow the bitmaps in compact format.  For the above
 * example, four intptr_t follows, corresponding to entry #0, #3, #11 and #12,
 * respectively.
