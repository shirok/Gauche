This is a port of Oleg Kiselyov's (S)XML utilities.
It also includes Kirill Lisovsky and Dmitry Lizorkin's sxpath implementation.

 Development:
  http://ssax.sourceforge.net/

The directory src/ contains the original source code.  Running 'make'
translates them to Gauche-specialized versions.  Ideally, you can
incorporate upstream's development into src directory and expect
it to work.  You may need to tweak trans.scm that defines the
translation rules.

The package contains the following components.

sxml.ssax - XML parser.  Parses XML documents to produce SXML structure.
   Based on SSAX CVS version 1.7 (Apr 9, 2003)
          This is available as module sxml.ssax from Gauche.

   SSAX -

   SXPATH - XPath for SXML.

   SXML-tree-trans - utility routines for SXML tree manipulation.
          Based on SXML-tree-trans version 1.5.
          This is available as module sxml.tree-trans from Gauche.

   SXML-to-HTML - translates SXML tree to HTML.
          Based on SXML-to-HTML version 1.3
          This is available as module sxml.to-html from Gauche.
