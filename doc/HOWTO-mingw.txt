A note on Windows/MinGW support

Now you can compile Gauche to use MinGW runtime library.  It is
the recommended way to build Gauche on Windows.  (You may still be
able to build with Cygwin but it has a few quirks that interfere
with Gauche that may surprise you.)

Because of the difference of the underlying system, not all
system-related procedures are available on MinGW port.
The reference manual tells whether a particular procedure
is supported on "Windows native".

As of 0.9.5, the official Windows binaries are built with
mingw-w64 (see http://mingw-w64.org/ ).  It may still be
built with the original MinGW, but our support efforts are
prioritized in favor of mingw-w64.  By 'MinGW version' in
the following sections, we mean Gauche built with mingw-w64.

If you just want to use Gauche on Windows, you can use the binary
installer.  Below, we describe what you need to build Gauche
from the source.


[Prerequisites]

You need the following software:

* MSYS2  http://msys2.github.io

   Download the installer and follow the instruction.  I recommend
   to leave the installation folder default (C:\msys64, for x86_64).
   After setup wizard finished, do not forget to follow the instruction
   in the above site to update packages.

   Once MSYS2 is in place, you can get mingw-w64 toolchain using
   pacman.  Fire MSYS2 shell and type 'pacman -S <package> ...'.
   For mingw-w64-*** packages, choose suitable architecture.
   NOTE: If you want to build x86_64 and i686 binary installers
   on x86_64 machine, you have to install both architecture versions.

   The following packages are needed:

   - mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc / mingw-w64-i686-gcc
   - autoconf
   - automake
   - libtool
   - pkg-config
   - make

   The following packages are strongly recommended.  Gauche can be built
   without them, but some features will not be available.

   - mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib / mingw-w64-i686-zlib
   - mingw-w64-x86_64-libiconv / mingw-w64-i686-libiconv
   - texinfo

   NOTE: pacman tries to install packages under c:/msys64/mingw64 etc,
   but sometimes the first attempt fails saying:

      error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files)
      ....  /mingw64 exists in filesystem

   There is /mingw64.exe and /mingw64.bat (in msys2 filesystem) and
   the installe gets confused.  Manually creating directory /mingw64
   will solve the problem.


* Gauche

   You need the latest release version of Gauche in order to build
   Gauche from git source.  Install it using binary installer, or,
   get a tarball and build it with MSYS2.

   Make sure that gosh is visible from the PATH of your MSYS shell.


* Wix toolset   http://wixtoolset.org

   (Optional) This is used to create installer.   If you just want
   to build just for your machine, you don't need this.


[Build]

You can build it just like on any other Unix systems; but for your
convenience, there's a script src/mingw-dist.sh which builds Gauche
in a way that you can zip and copy the resulting binary elsewhere,
or build a binary installer.

If you start from git repo clone (instead of source tarball), you
have to run './DIST gen' first to generate configure scripts.

Once configure scripts are in place, run the mingw-dist.sh on the
MSYS shell as follows:

   # For x86_64 build:
   $ MSYSTEM=MINGW64 src/mingw-dist.sh

   # For i686 build:
   $ MSYSTEM=MINGW32 src/mingw-dist.sh

The compiled binaries are in ../Gauche-mingw-dist/Gauche-x86_64 or
../Gauche-mingw-dist/Gauche-i686, respectively.  It includes DLLs
needed to run gosh, so you can just zip the directory and copy
to whatever machine you like.


[Build with Gauche-gl]

If you have Gauche-gl source tree aside of Gauche source tree
(that is, from Gauche's $top_srcdir, you have ../Gauche-gl),
you can build Gauche-gl as well.  Give --with-gl option:

   $ MSYSTEM=MINGW64 src/mingw-dist.sh --with-gl


[Build installer]

Make sure candle.exe and light.exe (WiX toolset) are in the PATH.

Run src/mingw-dist.sh with --with-installer option, for example:

   $ MSYSTEM=MINGW64 src/mingw-dist.sh --with-gl --with-installer

This creates installer file ../Gauche-mingw-X.X.X-{32|64}bit.msi.
