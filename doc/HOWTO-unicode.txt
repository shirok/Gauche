HOWTO: Updating character attributes to the latest Unicode standard

Gauche uses some of character attributes defined in Unicode
standard.  They are extraced from files provided as Unicode
Character Database (UCD), but we have it in packed format for
the space efficiency.

We use two stage build process for it:


             [UCD data files]
                    |
                    |
              make char-data
                    |
                    v
           [src/unicode-data.scm]
                    |
                    |
                   make 
                    |
                    v
             [src/char_attr.c]
         [ext/text/unicode_attr.h]


The first step reads UCD data files and generates src/unicode-data.scm,
which only includes necessary information.
This is only needed to be done when Unicode is updated; so we don't
require developers to do it.  We check in src/unicode-data.scm to
the repo.

The second step is run when you build Gauche from the repository
source tree.  When creating tarball, though, we pre-generate
the final char_attr.c and unicode_attr.h so that those who build
from the tarball won't need preinstalled gosh.

The rest of this document explains when you need to regenerate
src/unicode-data.scm.


Preparing UCD data files
------------------------

You need to obtain the following files from the Unicode site
( http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/ )

    UnicodeData.txt
    SpecialCasing.txt
    PropList.txt
    auxiliary/GraphemeBreakProperty.txt
    auxiliary/WordBreakProperty.txt

Save those files in some directory (we call it $UNICODEDIR).
Note that you need to keep subdirectory (auxiliary/).

The list of files may grow in future versions of Gauche.


Review the changes
------------------

Property values may be added in the newer Unicode version,
so check src/gauche/char_attr.h and the beginning of
src/gen-unicode.scm to see if we need to update.  We take advantage
of property value distribution over codepoints for space-efficient
encoding (e.g. using flat tables on some ranges and binary trees
on others).   You may need to tweak the code if new range of
characters are added.

Check changes in TR29 ( http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/ ).
The state-transition table is hardcoded in ext/text/unicode.scm
(they can't be extracted from UCD files).  Any change in TR29
must be manually reflected to the code.


Generate unicode-data.scm
-------------------------

There's a make rule for that.

    $ cd src
    $ make UNICODEDIR=$UNICODEDIR char-data

And it's done!
