If you're new to this project and want to try compiling from git repo,
check link:HACKING.adoc[] first.  If it is your first time to build Gauche, 
you should start from the release tarball instead of git clone; see
https://practical-scheme.net/gauche/download.html on how to get the tarball.
Once you get and untar the release tarball, see link:INSTALL.adoc[]
for the instructions.  (If you're reading this in text editor,
INSTALL.en.adoc or INSTALL.ja.adoc are English-only and Japanese-only
