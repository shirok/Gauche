# Git repo attributes.

# Ensure all text files have normalized (LF) line endings in the repository.
* text=auto

# These files should use CR/LF line ending:
/BCC_MAKEFILE -text
/digimars.mak -text

# Note: "core.eol" configuration variable controls which line endings to use
# for the normalized files in the working directory (the default is native).
