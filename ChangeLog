2001-03-23  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@scherzo>

	* release 0.2.9

	  "(use gauche.something)".
	* src/class.c, src/gauche/class.h: changed ScmClassAccessor to
	  ScmSlotAccessor and made it have more information for slot
	  initialization and access.   Basic features such as defining
	  class in Scheme, instancing it, and accessing slots, start
	  working---a lot has to be done for completeness.

	  the stack by quasiquoted forms with unquote and unquote-splicing
	  intertwined.

2001-03-16  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@scherzo>

	* release 0.2.4

	  appropriate modules.
	* src/boolean.c etc.: equivalent preicate C API now returns C boolean
