;; Recursive hash function
;; This is here instead of in libdict.scm, for we need the rest of
;; the runtime to be initialized.
;;
;; Equal-hash can be extended by defining object-hash method.  We used
;; to have just one hash function of this type, 'hash', so the existing
;; object-hash calls 'hash' whenever it needs to recurse.
;;
;; Now that we have mutliple hash functions that works as equal hash,
;; we need a way for object-hash to recursively call the proper equal
;; hash function.  Thus we pass the current hash function as the second
;; argument of object-hash.
;;
;; However, we can't break the existing object-hash code that takes
;; just one argument, an object to hash, and recursively calls 'hash'
;; function.  So here's a trick we employed:
;;
;;   1. The 'hash' function actually dispatches to the current recursive
;;      hash function.
;;   2. The default of current recursive hash function is the
;;      legacy-hash, for the compatibility.
;;   3. During the execution of 'portable-hash' or 'default-hash',
;;      we set the current recursive hash function to it so that
;;      'hash' actually calls back to the proper hash function.
