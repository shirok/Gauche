/* Box is a heap-allocated object that can hold one Scheme value.
 * It is internally used to realize indirection for mutable local
 * variables.   Conceptually, the compiler translates initialization,
 * reference and mutation of mutable local variables into construction,
 * dereference and mutation of box, as follows:
 *
 * Original code:
 *
 *   (let ((var 1))
 *     ...
 *     (foo var)
 *     ...
 *     (set! var 2)
 *     ...)
 *
 * Translated:
 *
 *   (let ((var (%make-box 1)))
 *     ...
 *     (foo (%box-ref var))
 *     ...
 *     (%box-set! var 2)
 *     ...)
 *
 * Local variables that are never set! won't be translated.
 *
 * After this translation, *all* local variables are immutable.  It makes
 * optimization a lot easier.
