;; This is intended to replace 'install' program, in order to avoid
;; variations of system's install program.  Although most 'install'
;; programs have various extensions, we can't reliably use those
;; extended features since we don't know such extended install program
;; is avilable on the target system.  Assuming minimum featured install
;; program makes makefile messy.
