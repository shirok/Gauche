;; Pass 4.  Lambda lifting
;;

;; First we traverse down the IForm and find free local variables
;; for each lambda node.  Within this traversal, found $lambda nodes
;; are chained into the first element of label-dic.
;;
;; Once all free lvars are sorted out, we look at the list of $lambda
;; nodes and determine the ones that doesn't need to form a closure.
;; They are to be bound to a freshly created global identifier.  If other
;; $lambda nodes have a reference to the lifted lambda node through
;; local variables, they are substituted to the reference to this global
;; identifier.
;;
;; Note for the reader of this code: The term "lambda lifting" usually
;; includes a transformation that substitutes closed variables for
;; arguments.  We don't do such transformation so far.  It trades the
;; cost of closure allocation for pushing extra arguments.  It may be
;; a win if the closure is allocated lots of times.  OTOH, if the closure
;; is created only a few times, but called lots of times, the overhead of
;; extra arguments may exceed the gain by not allocating the closure.
;;
;; Pass4 is done in three steps.
;;
;; - The first step, pass4/scan, recursively descends the IForm and determine
;;   a set of free variables for each $LAMBDA nodes.  It also collects lambda
;;   nodes inside the iform into label-dic-info.
;;   In this pass, we mark the toplevel lambda node by setting
;;   $lambda-lifted-var to #t.  All other lambda nodes have #f at this moment.
;;
;; - The second step, pass4/lift, takes a set of $LAMBDA nodes in the IForm
;;   and finds which $LAMBDA nodes can be lifted.  When lifted, we set
;;   its $lambda-lifted-var with the variable that bound to the lifted lambda.
;;
;; - The third step, pass4/subst, walks the IForm again, and replaces the
;;   occurence of $LAMBDA nodes to be lifted for $LREFs.  Then wraps the
;;   entire iform with $LET to save the lifted lambdas.
;;
;; This pass introduces CL-like toplevel environment, e.g.
;;
;;   ($let rec (<lvar> ...)
;;             (($lambda ...) ...)   ; lifted lambdas
;;     ($define ...)                 ; toplevel definition
;;     )
;;
;; This works, since we already dissolved internal defines, and the $DEFINE
;; we have is all toplevel defines, and the toplevel variable to be bound
;; is already resolved to the identifier.
;; NB: Whether we use 'rec' or not in this outermost lambda doesn't matter,
;; for we directly refer to <lvar>s.  We just use 'rec' to remind it is
;; conceptually a letrec.
