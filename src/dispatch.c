/*
 * Method dispatch acceleration
 *
 *  gf->dispatcher may contain a structure that accelerates method dispatch.
 *  The structure must be treated as opaque from other parts.
 *
 *  In the current implementation, we use special open-addressing hash table.
 *  We don't use ScmHashCore for a few reasons:
 *  
 *   - We mutex modification of the table by gf->mutex, but we don't want
 *     to lock for searching it.  ScmHashCore doesn't guarantee consistency
 *     of reading while modifying.
 *   - It is in performance critical path, and we can take advantage of
 *     domain knowledge to make it faster than generic implementation.
 *
 *  At this moment, the dispatch accelerator isn't built automatically.
 *  You need to call gauche.object#generic-build-dispatcher! explicitly
 *  on a generic function.  The effect varies depending on the methods
 *  the GF has, so we selectively turn on this feature for speed-sensitive
 *  GFs and see how it goes.  If it is proven to be effective enough,
 *  we might implement an automated mechanism when GF meets certain
 *  criteria.
 *
 *  We take advantage of the following facts:
 *
 *   - Once we hit the leaf method we don't need to find less-specific
 *     methods at all.
 *   - Some generic functions has methods most of which are leaf methods,
 *     and can be mostly specialized by a single argument.  The typical
 *     example is `ref'.
 *
 *  When methods are mostly specilized by N-th argument, we call the N
 *  as AXIS (zero based).  Typically, methods tend to be specialized by
 *  the first argument, in which case axis is 0.
 *
 *  The method dispatcher contains a hash table, where each key is
 *  a tuple (<class>, <number-of-args>), and its value is a list of
 *  methods, whose axis specializer is <class> and which can take
 *  <number-of-args>.
 *
 *  When a GF with dispatch accelerator is called, we retrieve the class
 *  of the axis of the actual argument, and lookup the hash table with
 *  that class and the number of actual arguments.  If we have a hit,
 *  and the entry solely consists of leaf methods,
 *  the list of methods are the list of applicable methods---since there
 *  are no more specific methods, and we don't need to look for less specific
 *  methods.  This means...
 *
 *   - We don't need to go through the entire method list to find
 *     all applicable methods.
 *   - We don't need to allocate to construct the list of applicable
 *     methods.
 *
 *  Note that if the entry has at least one non-leaf methods, we have to
 *  fall back to the normal path, since there may be other applicable
 *  methods that might be called via next-method.  To cut the overhead
 *  of checking, we keep the list of leaf methods and the one of non-leaf
 *  methods separately.
 */

/* On concurrent access:
 *
 *   We don't want to lock the method hash for every invocation of GF.
 *   So we employ some atomic pointer operations so that readers can
 *   see the consistent state even another thread is modifying it.
 *
 *   We still aquire GF lock whenever we modify the mhash, so there's
 *   at most one thread that's modifying it.  Modification is only required
 *   when a new method is added to the GF or any one of classes that
 *   specializes one of the methods is redefined.
 *
 *   The modification is done by making a modified copy of (sub)structure
 *   and then swap the pointer atomically, thus the concurrent reader
 *   won't see inconsistent state.
 *
 *   The locking on GF is done in class.c.
