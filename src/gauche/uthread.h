   The variable of type ScmInternalThread must be initialized by
   SCM_INTERNAL_THREAD_INIT.  You can check if the variable is
   initialized or not by SCM_INTERNAL_THREAD_INITIALIZED_P.

   SCM_INTERNAL_THREAD_GETCURRENT() should return the current thread.
   SCM_INTERNAL_THREAD_SETSPECIFIC(key, val) sets the value to the
   thread-local storage identified by key.  It should evaluate
   to TRUE on success, FALSE on error.

   SCM_INTERNAL_THREAD_CLEANUP_{PUSH|POP} is an abstraction similar
   to pthread_cleanup_{push|pop}.  We assume no Scheme error is
   signalled between these macros.

   SCM_INTERNAL_THREAD_PROC_RET{TYPE|VAL} specify return type and value
   of the thread entry procedure.  See ext/threads/threads.c.

/* ScmInternalMutex - a mutex structure.

   The variable of type ScmInternaMutex must be initialized by
   SCM_INTERNAL_MUTEX_INIT at runtime.  If a static initializer is
   needed, SCM_INTERNAL_MUTEX_INITIALIZER---but it's merely for making
   the compiler happy, and does not guarantee the mutex is initialized.
   You still need to use SCM_INTERNAL_MUTEX_INIT.   The resources
   associated to the mutex would be released by SCM_INTERNAL_MUTEX_DESTROY.

   To lock/unlock the mutex, SCM_INTERNAL_MUTEX_LOCK and
   SCM_INTERNAL_MUTEX_UNLOCK can be used.   They should be used
   with care, especially the thread should not be canceled between
   them.

   If you need to have a cancellable code in the critical
   section, you should use SCM_INTERNAL_MUTEX_SAFE_LOCK_BEGIN and
   SCM_INTERNAL_MUTEX_SAFE_LOCK_END.  They use cleanup mechanism
   provided by the underlying system, such as pthread_cleanup_push/pop,
   to make sure the mutex is unlocked when the thread terminates.
   These macros must be used in the pair at the same syntactic scope,
   for they can be expanded to opening block and closing block tokens,
   respectively.
