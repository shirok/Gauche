/* Footnotes on ScmCompiledCodeRec
 *
 *   *1) This may be NULL if this compiled code is "partially compiled"---
 *       that is, the compiler only runs pass1 and put the intermediate
 *       form in intermediateForm field.
 *   *2) For the C-dumped code, the code vector is located in a static data
 *       area, subject to GC scanning.  In that case, the constants pointer
 *       is NULL.
 *   *3) ((<offset> <info> ...) ...)
 *       <offset> is either an instruction offset or 'definition (for the
 *       entire closure).
 *       At this moment, only used <info> is (source-info . <source>).
 *   *4) (<signature> <info> ...)
 *       <signature> is (<procedure-name> <formal> ...)
 *       <procedure-name> may be just a symbol, or a list (in case of internal
 *       function).  There's no precise definition for the format yet---it's
 *       for debug information.  See Scm_CompiledCodeFullName().
 *       <formal> ... is the formal argument list, as appears in the original
 *       lambda form, including :key, :optional etc.
 *       <info> is a form of (<key> . <value>).  For now, we have 'type
 *       as a key, and <value> contains symbolic type signature such as
 *       '(<list> <integer> * -> *).  We may add more <key>s later.
 *   *5) This IForm is a direct result of Pass1, i.e. non-optimized form.
 *       Pass2 scans it when IForm is inlined into the caller site.
