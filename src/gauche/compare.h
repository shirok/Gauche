/* Difference between srfi-114 and srfi-128:
   srfi-114 uses (compare a b) => -1 (a<b), 0 (a=b) or 1 (a>b)
   srfi-128 uses (order a b)   => #t (a<b) or #f (a>=b)
   We can emulate one by the other, but emulation has some overhead.
   So we allow both, and try to use whichever provided to the
   constructor.  (We do emulate if comparator-comparison-procedure
   is called on srfi-128-constructed comparator, etc.)

   Flags:

   SCM_COMPARATOR_NO_ORDER - The comparator can't order.
     (neither compare fn nor order fn is given to the constructor;
      note that compareFn and orderFn members have dummy procedure
      in that case).

   SCM_COMPARATOR_NO_HASH - The comparator can't hash.
     (hash fn is not given to the constructor; note that hashFn member
      has dummy procedure)

   SCM_COMPARATOR_ANY_TYPE - The comparator can accept any Scheme object.
     A small optimization to skip type tests.   

   SCM_COMPARATOR_USE_COMPARISON - Records the fact that #t is passed
     to the equality-test in srfi-114 style constructor.  We use compareFn
     for the equality check.

   SCM_COMPARATOR_SRFI_128 - Indicates this is srfi-128-style comparator,
     so using orderFn is preferred to compareFn.
