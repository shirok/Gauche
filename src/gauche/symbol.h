/* Compatibility note: The 'flags' slot in ScmSymbol used to be an
 * 'interned', just to keep whether the symbol is interned or not.
 * We changed it in 0.9.2 to allow future extensions.
 * All statically defined ScmSymbol has initialized this slot by
 * either 0 or 1, so we can make use of the rest of bits; however,
 * the existing code checks SCM_SYMBOL_INTERNED without the mask,
 * so, in order to keep the binary compatibility, we can set other
 * bits of flags only if the symbol is interened.   This restriction
 * can be removed upon 1.0 release.
