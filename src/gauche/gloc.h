/* About negative binding:
 *
 *   Negative binding is a dummy binding inserted in an intermediate
 *   anonymous module created by 'import' form, to realize :except
 *   and :rename modifiers.   It *never* occurs in modules created
 *   explicitly by define-module form or make-module procedure.
 *
 *   While Scm_FindBinding searches imported modules and parent modules,
 *   if it finds negative binding, it stop searching for the MPL chain
 *   currently it is looking at.  In other word, a negative binding
 *   has an effect to remove the inherited binding from the exported list.
 *
 * About phantom binding.
 *
 *   A binding may be inserted either by definition or export special
 *   forms.  We don't know which comes first.  If we've seen only an
 *   'export' form but not an actual definition, the GLOC of the binding
 *   has value SCM_UNBOUND, and indicates it is a phantom binding.
 *
 *   When we meet a phantom binding during searching a binding of a symbol,
 *   we recursively search the symbol from the module where the phantom
 *   bindings are in, and returns bound GLOC if found.
 *
 *   Example:
 *     (define-module a (export foo) (define foo 1))
 *     (define-module b (import a) (export foo))
 *     Suppose we (import b) and then access 'foo'.  We search the import
 *     chain and find a phantom binding of 'foo' in #<module b>.
 *     In this case, we search 'foo' from #<module b>, and find a gloc
 *     from #<module a>, which is returned as the result of the search.
 *
 *   This makes it easy to create a transitive module, that doesn't
 *   define bindings by itself, but exports subset of imported bindings.
 *
 * Hooks (getter and setter)
 *   All reference and modification of toplevel binding go through
 *   SCM_GLOC_GET/SET macros, which check getter and setter handlers.
 *   These handlers allow to hook global variable reference.  They
 *   are reserved for internal use; its' not for application-level
 *   abstraction.  As of 0.9, getter is not used, and setter is only
 *   used to check the attempt of modifying constant bindings.
 *   Future plans include some kind of debugging facility.
