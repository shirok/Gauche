/* We implement char-sets as hybrid of bitmap and binary tree.
 *
 * Bitmap is used for "small" characters, i.e. characters between
 * U+0000 and U+007F.  There, each bit represents whether the
 * character is in the set (1) or not (0).
 *
 * For larger characters, we keep the range of included chars
 * in a binary tree.  For each entry, its key is the start char code
 * and its value is the end char code (inclusive).
 * For example, if the character set has characters between
 * U+3040 and U+30FF, and U+4E00 and U+9FBF, then the tree has
 * the following entries:
 *   #x3040 => #x30ff, #x4e00 => #x9fbf.
 *
 * We have mutable char-set (default) and immutable or frozen char-set.
 * Mutable char-set uses ScmTreeCore for the large characters.  Immutable
 * char-set uses flat u32vector, sorted by the key and accessed by binary
 * search.
 *
 * Immutable charset is a new addition.  Since we have to keep ABI
 * compatibility, the layout is a bit weird during 0.9 series;
 * the existing binary checks Scm_TreeCoreNumEntries(cs->large.tree) == 0
 * for SCM_CHAR_SET_SMALLP, so after we introduce immutable set, we have
 * to make sure immutable set
