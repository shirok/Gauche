/*================================================================
 * Locking the ports
 *
 *  Since most of the public APIs locks the ports, you don't usually
 *  need to lock the ports by yourself.   The following macros
 *  shouldn't be used casually.
 *
 *  Port locking overhead is critical to the I/O performance.
 *  The following macros are designed carefully so that it minimizes
 *  the call to the system-level lock primitives, under the assumption
 *  that port access never conflicts in the performance critical code.
 *  (It doesn't make much sense for multiple threads to write to the
 *  same port, since the outputs are mixed in unpredictable way---except
 *  a casual debug print to stderr, but I don't believe performance
 *  critical part does that.)
 *
 *  The port's lock state is kept in a single pointer, port->lockOwner.
 *  It points to the owner of the port, or NULL if the port is unlocked.
 *  Unlocking the port is a single atomic opertaion, port->lockOwner = NULL,
 *  hence PORT_UNLOCK doesn't need mutex to do that.
 *
 *  To lock the port, the thread needs to grab a system-level lock
 *  (spinlock if available, mutex otherwise) to check the lockOwner
 *  pointer.  If the port is locked, the thread yields CPU and
 *  try again later.
 *
 *  It is possible that lockOwner slot changes its value to NULL during
 *  a thread is trying to lock the port, since PORT_UNLOCK doesn't obtain
 *  the system-level lock.  If it happens, the thread trying to lock
 *  the port would wait extra timeslice.  Not a big deal.
 *
 *  Note that we cannot use a condition variable to let the locking thread
 *  wait on it.  If we use CV, unlocking becomes two-step opertaion
 *  (set lockOwner to NULL, and call cond_signal), so it is no longer
 *  atomic.  We would need to get system-level lock in PORT_UNLOCK as well.
