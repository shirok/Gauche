/* ScmBits utilities are to manage bit array in an array of u_longs.

   The LSB of the first word is the bit #0.  The MSB of the first
   word is the bit #31 or #63, and the LSB of the second word is the
   bit #32 or #64, and so on.
   The user can use ScmBits as opaque structure and don't need to
   worry about the bit ordering.  For internal hackers: ScmBits are
   also used in bignum.c, and it must maintain this bit ordering.
   It is important that ScmBignum->values can be casted to ScmBits*.
