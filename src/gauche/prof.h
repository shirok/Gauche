/*=============================================================
 * Profiler
 */

/* We have two types of profilers, a statistic sampler and call-counter.
 *
 * The statistic sampler uses ITIMER_PROF and records the current code
 * base and PC for every SIGPROF.
 * (NB: in order for this to work, VM's PC must always be saved
 * in VM structure; in another word, vm.c must be compiled with
 * SMALL_REGS == 0).
 *
 * The call counter records every event of CALL and TAIL-CALL instruction
 * execution on the thread.   Each entry just records the address of
 * the called object.
 *
 * TODO: It is not known if sampling profiler works when more than one
 * thread requests profiling.  Should be considrered later.
 *
 * When the on-memory buffer of the call counter gets full, it is collected
 * to a hash table.  When the statistic sampling buffer gets full, it
 * is flushed to a temporary file (we can't use a hashtable, since the
 * flushing may be done within a signal handler and we can't call allocator
 * in it).
 *
 * Profiler status:
 *
 *        Scm_ProfilerStart    Scm_ProfilerStop
 *            -------->         --------->
 *    INACTIVE          RUNNING           PAUSING -----\
 *                              <--------              |
 *        ^                    Scm_ProfilerStart       |
 *        |                                            |
 *        \--------------------------------------------/
 *                      Scm_ProfilerReset
 *
 * Profile result can only be examined when the profile is in "PAUSING"
 * state.
