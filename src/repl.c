/* C API - deprecated
   main.c used to call this to invoke repl, but now it uses
   Scm_EvalCString.   Now we have multiple versions of read-eval-print-loop
   (the 'bare' one in libeval.scm and the user-friendly one in
   gauche.interactive), we want to allow the caller to specify which.
   Furthermore, the caller always use Scm_Eval family to call desired
   read-eval-print-loop.   Hence the point of having this API as is
   is diminishing.
