;;; fsdbm uses a filesystem to store dbm-type database.
;;; A key is filename, and its value is the content of the file.
;;; Obviously, it is not suitable for the database that has
;;; lots of entries, have entries deleted and added very frequently,
;;; or has long keys.  The advantage is when the number of entries
;;; are relatively small, and the values are relatively large while
;;; keys are small.
;;;
;;; Fsdbm pathname is used for a directory that stores the data.
;;; The top-level directory has 37 data directories (z[0-9a-z_]),
;;; 'Incoming' directory, and a version file (FSDBM).
;;;
;;; When a new entry is added to the database, it first creates
;;; the file whose name is the key under Incoming directory, and
;;; stores the value into the file.  Then it moves the file to
;;; one of the data directories, depending on the hash value of the key.
;;;
;;; If key has non-alphanumeric characters, it is encoded into _XX
;;; manner.  If key is very long (more than 200 bytes) it is
;;; chopped by 200 bytes each, and every chunk but the last one
;;; are used as a directory name.
;;;
;;; Modification of the entry is done in the same manner.  The new
;;; entry is prepared in Incoming directory, and then replaced to
;;; the current entry.
;;;
;;; With this scheme, no race condition will occur in each entry's
;;; read/write.  It is naturally taken care of by the file system.
;;; It uses fcntl advisory lock to prevent race conditions that involve
;;; more than one entries, whenever available.
