;; This is a compability facade of Gauche's native lseq.
;; Srfi-127's lseq is conceptually a list terminated by a generator:
;;
;;  Lseq :: () | (x . Generator) | (x . Lseq)
;;
;; However, generally there's no guarantee that how many elements are
;; realized in a given lseq, so no portable code should count on
;; (cdr lseq) => <generator>.
;;
;; One deviation of srfi-127 is the constructor generator->lseq: It
;; explicitly specifies to return (x . Generator) of the given generator
;; yields non-EOF object.  We return Gauche's built-in lseq, which is
;; operationally equivalent to srfi-127's lseq but you cannot get
;; the generator itself in the cdr.
