;; JOB is a common structure used by several control flow libraries
;; The use of slots are up to those libraries, and generally the end
;; user shouldn't care.
;;
;; A job can be used in three flavors w.r.t. multithread environemnt.
;;  'waitable'    - Threads can wait on a job to be finished.
;;  'cancellable' - A job can be forcibly marked as 'killed' by a thread
;;                  other than its runner.  It doesn't guarantee that
;;                  the runner thread stops immediately, but the job is
;;                  regarded as finished.  Waitable job is also cancellable,
;;                  and waiting threads are waked up when the job is
;;                  cancelled.
;;  bare          - A job is neither cancellable nor waitable.
