;;; Given set of values S1, S2, ..., Sn, a relation R is a set of tuples
;;; such that the first element of a tuple is from S1, the second from
;;; S2, ..., and the n-th from Sn.  In another word, R is a subset of
;;; Cartesian product of S1, ..., Sn.
;;;
;;; (This is actually THE definition from the original Codd's 1970 paper,
;;; "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks", in
;;; CACM 13(6) pp.377--387.)
;;;
;;; This definition can be applied to various datasets: A set of Gauche
;;; instances is a relation, if you view each instance as a tuple and
;;; each slot value as the actual values.  A list of lists can be a
;;; relation.  A stream that reads from CSV table produces a relation.
;;; Thus it would be useful to provide a module that implements generic
;;; operations on relations, no matter how the actual representation is.
;;;
;;; From the operational point of view, we can treat any datastructure
;;; that provides the following two properties.
;;;
;;;  - a collection of tuples (rows), which should be a <collection> or
;;     one of its subclasses (e.g. <sequence>).
;;;  - metadata to retrieve individual column value from a given tuple.
;;;
;;; One can implement a relation by writing at least four methods,
;;; relation-column-names, relation-column-getter and relation-column-setter,
;;; and relation-rows.
;;;
;;; On top of that abstraction, we can implement a bunch of useful stuff.
;;; We'll add them, but here are some ideas.
;;;
;;;  - Codd's relational operations
;;;  - A relation that wraps existing relations, adding index operation.
