;; Unify two trees.
;;
;;   Tree : Variable | Value | Tuple
;;   Tuple : {Tree ...}
;;
;; The algorithm is independent of the actual representation of the trees
;; to unify.  The caller must provide the following parameters that abstracts
;; the representation of the target tree T.
;;
;;   var-cmpr      A comparator to test, compare and hash "variables".
;;                 Must be hashable.
;;   val-cmpr      A comparator to test and compare "values".  Values
;;                 are non-variable terminals.  A tree node that are
;;                 neither a variable nor a value is a tuple.
;;   (tuple-fold proc seed x [y])
;;        :: (Tree a -> a) a Tree -> a
;;        or (Tree Tree a -> a) a Tree Tree -> a
;;                 Fold elements in the tuple, applying PROC, just like
;;                 fold.  It must be able to fold over one or two tuples.

;; API
;; Unify two trees A and B, and returns a substition dictionary
;; If A and B are not unifyable, returns #t.
