;; Procedures to calculate Levenshtein, Damerau-Levenshtein, and
;; Restricted edit distances of two sequences
;; (not limited to strings).

;; Note: 
;;  Those widely known algorithms were extensively researched in 60s
;;  to 70s, and sometimes different researchers reported same or similar
;;  algorithms without attaching specific name.  We took widely known
;;  names but the source we found didn't have that names.
;;
;;  Levenshtein distance: Wagner & Fischer, The String-to-string correction
;;  problem, JACM 21(1), 1974, shows DP algorithm to calculate this, but
;;  there's no mention of "Levenshtein" in the paper.
;;
;;  Damerau-Levenshtein-distance: Lowrance & Wagner, An extention of
;;  the string-to-string correction problem, JACM 22(2), 1975.  Again,
;;  there's no mention of "Damerau" nor "Levenshtein".
;;
;;  Restricted edit distance: Oommen & Loke, Pattern
;;  recognition of strings with substitutions, insertions, deletions
;;  and generalized transpositions, Pattern Recognition 30(5), 1997.
;;  This one is mentioned as Optimal string alignment distance in
;;  Wikipedia.  The paper doesn't give itself a name, but claims it's
;;  "less restrictive" than Lowrance & Wagner since it removes the cost
;;  restriction that Lowrance & Wagner requires to work.  On the other
;;  hand, this one restricts how transposition is applied and is not
;;  fully compatible to Damerau-Levenshtein.

;; It is often explaned using (N+k)x(M+k) array for dynamic programming
;; (k=1 or 2), but we only need to refer to look back at most k rows,
;; so we can run the algorithm with k+1 rows and rotating them.

;; Three algorithms only differ slightly in details and it's tempting to
;; factor the common part out.  However such arrangement introduces overhead
;; and the resulting code isn't that clean.  So we decided to implement
;; each separately, allowing some redundancy among their code.
;;
;; NB: Usually, the algorithm is described as sequences with 1-base index,
;; and array index start from 0 or -1 up to the length of the sequence.
;; We use 0-base vector, so the row index is offset by 1 or 2.
;;
;; The base implementation of every algorithm has the following signature:
;;
;;  (base A Bs elt= cutoff)
;;
;; This calculates distance between sequence A and each sequence in the
;; list of sequence Bs, and returns the list of distances.
;; elt= is used to compare elements in the sequence.  cutoff can be #f
;; or a positive integer, and if it's positive integer, we stop calculating
;; the distance of a particular pair as soon as the minimum distance
;; exceeds the value; the distance for that pair becomes #f.

;; Restricted Edit distance
;;
;; This one treats transposition as one operation, but does not allow
;; editing a transposed pair afterwards.
;;
;; We need two columns/rows for the boundary, so when we're looking
;; at A[i] and B[j], the matrix cell is (i+2, j+2) and we look at
;;  (i+1, j+2) - deletion
;;  (i+2, j+1) - insertion
;;  (i+1, j+1) - same or substitution
;;  (i, j)     - transposition
;; and j+2 = row-0, j+1 = row-1, j = row-2.

;; Damerau-Levenshtein distance

;; Typical DL algorithm uses an array indexed by character code, but
;; that does not work with large character set or general objects.
;; For the time being, we use an assoc list.  It needs O(length(A))
;; to look up, but in general length(A) is small and the constant
;; factor is very small for alist (we could go with tree map, for
;; example, if an element comparator is provided, but the constant factor
;; of it could surpass the log order benefit if length(A) is small.)
