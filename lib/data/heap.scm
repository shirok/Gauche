;; We use min-max heap; whatever gain earned by limiting to min-heap
;; or max-heap would be small compared to other overhead.

;; Min-max heaps and generalized priority queues, CACM 29(10) pp.996-1000
;; Oct. 1986, http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/6617.6621

;; Binary heap is stored in an array, S[].  
;;
;; - S[1] is the root.
;; - S[i]'s child is S[2i] and S[2i+1]
;; - S[i]'s parent is S[floor(i/2)] when i > 1.
;; - Stored data can be anything comparable.
;;
;; Since S[0] won't be used, we treat the backing storage as 1-based;
;; that is, S[1] is stored in the first element, and so on.
;;
;; Backing storage can be either a flat vector (vector, uvector) or
;; a sparse vector.  If it is a flat vector, the heap has maximum size
;; (we don't extend the buffer automatically).
