;; This class takes care of various cache algorithms.
;; The cache works like a dictionary that you can associate value
;; to a key.  The entry may disappear silently, when it is expired
;; according to the cache policy.  This module is inspired by Clojure's
;; core.cache, but note that the API spec is different from Clojure's.
;;
;; User-side API
;;
;;  (make-***-cache [args ...] :key storage comparator ...)   procedure
;;     Arguments varies depending on the alrogithm.
;;
;;  (cache-lookup! cache key [default]) => value              procedure
;;  (cache-through! cache key value-fn) => value              procedure
;;  (cache-evict! cache key) => void                             method
;;  (cache-clear! cache) => void                                 method
;;  (cache-write! cache key value) => void                       method
;;
;;  (cache-storage cache) => dictionary                       procedure
;;  (cache-compartor cache) => comparator                     procedure
;;
;; Implementor-side API
;;
;;  An implementation of cache algorithm must provide at least the
;;  following two methods:
;;
;;  (cache-check! cache key) => Maybe (key . value)
;;     Check if key has a value in cache.   If not, returns #f.
;;     If it does, returns a cons of the key and the value.
;;
;;  (cache-register! cache key value) => (key . value)
;;     Called when cache doesn't have an entry for the key, in order
;;     to insert the value with the key.
;;     This inserts the key-value pair into the cache, and returns
;;     cons of them.
;;
;;  The initialize method must take care of set up the internal state.
;;  It should also handle the case when the existing dictionary is given.
;;
;;  The default method of cache-evict! and cache-clear! only takes
;;  care of the storage.  If the algorithm needs to modify other internal
;;  states, it should override those methods.
;;
;;  The default method of cache-write! is evict! + register!.  In most
;;  cases there exists a better way.

;; Some common routines
;;  Most of cache implementations uses a queue as an auxiliary struct.
;;  They keep <key> -> (<n> . <value>) in the storage, and
;;  pushd (<key> . <n>) into the queue, where <n> is a number and
;;  monotonically increasing within the queue.   There may be multiple
;;  entries with the same <key> in the queue.
;;  Although the meaning of <n> depends on the algorithm, some
;;  operations can be common.

;; Queue must be an empty queue.  Fills queue according to the contents of
;; storage.  This is called from initialize, in order to set up a cache
;; with existing storage.  Returns maximum <n>.
