;; Legacy syntax:
;;  #`"The value is ,(foo)." => (string-append "The value is " (foo) ".")
;;
;; New syntax:
;;  #"The value is ~(foo)." => (string-append "The value is " (foo) ".")
;;
;; The reader reads #"... ~expr ..."  as #,(string-interpolate "... ~expr ...").
;; The reader-ctor calls string-interpolate, which parses the given string
;; and expands the whole form into a macro call:
;;  (string-interpolate* "... ~expr ..." ("... " expr " ..."))
;; The macro string-interpolate* further expands into string-append and
;; x->string:
;;  (string-append "... " (x->string expr) " ...")
;;
;; We need this multi-step expansion for the following reasons:
;;
;;  1) We have to parse target string and extract embedded expressions
;;     _before_ macro expansion.  Otherwise we can't handle hygiene of
;;     embedded expressions.
;;  2) If we do some source-to-source translation, the expansion of
;;     the reader macro will be embedded in the output.  For the possibility
;;     of future expansion, we'd like to keep intermediate form that does
;;     minimal expansion (in our case, parsing the template string and
;;     extract expressions).  By that, we can tweak the macro later.
;;
;; One caveat of reader macro approach is that it inserts global identifier
;; (string-interpolate*) unhygienically.  We could cheat by directly inserting
;; an identifier, but it turned out a bad idea because it won't work well
;; with source-to-source translators.   So we gave up hygiene and ask
;; users that they need to use #"..." where gauche#string-interpolate* is
;; visible.  After all, it's Gauche's extension, so you can't use it
;; in portable R7RS code, anyway.
;;
;; We use 'read' to get expression after reading an unquote character
;; (#\, for the legacy syntax, #\~ for the new syntax.)  This presents
;; a problem if the expression is an indentfier, immediately followed by
;; a non-delimiting character.  Suppose we have #"It's ~foo."  After
;; reading #\~, we call 'read', which reads an identifier named "foo.",
;; but the original intention might be an identifier "foo", followed by
;; a literal ".".
;;
;; An easy solution, which we currently use, is to delimit the symbol
;; by vertical bars: #"It's ~|foo|."   It is logical---the 'read' procedure
;; just reads "|foo|" as a symbol foo, regadless of what's following---but
;; I don't like it, for it looks visually as if we have a special syntax
;; for the single-variable case, even though we don't.
;;
;; One idea is to use curly-braces: ~{foo}.  Instead of having it a 'special'
;; syntax, we can interpret it as a srfi-105 (curly-infix) syntax, in which
;; {expr} is just expr.  If we support srfi-105 by default, this feature comes
;; for free.  We don't know yet, though.
