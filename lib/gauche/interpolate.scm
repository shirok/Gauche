;; Legacy syntax:
;;  #`"The value is ,(foo)." => (string-append "The value is " (foo) ".")
;;
;; New syntax:
;;  #"The value is ~(foo)." => (string-append "The value is " (foo) ".")
;;
;; We use 'read' to get expression after reading an unquote character
;; (#\, for the legacy syntax, #\~ for the new syntax.)  This presents
;; a problem if the expression is an indentfier, immediately followed by
;; a non-delimiting character.  Suppose we have #"It's ~foo."  After
;; reading #\~, we call 'read', which reads an identifier named "foo.",
;; but the original intention might be an identifier "foo", followed by
;; a literal ".".
;;
;; An easy solution, which we currently use, is to delimit the symbol
;; by vertical bars: #"It's ~|foo|."   It is logical---the 'read' procedure
;; just reads "|foo|" as a symbol foo, regadless of what's following---but
;; I don't like it, for it looks visually as if we have a special syntax
;; for the single-variable case, even though we don't.
;;
;; One idea is to use curly-braces: ~{foo}.  Instead of having it a 'special'
;; syntax, we can interpret it as a srfi-105 (curly-infix) syntax, in which
;; {expr} is just expr.  If we support srfi-105 by default, this feature comes
;; for free.  We don't know yet, though.
