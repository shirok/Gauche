;; To remember editor name user typed in
(define *user-entered-editor* #f)

;; API
;; (ed path-or-proc :key editor load-after)
;;   Starts an external editor.  The editor program path is determined
;; in the following order:
;;
;;   - The :editor keyword argument, if it's not #f.
;;   - The value of *editor* in the user module, if defined.
;;   - The value of the environment variable GAUCHE_EDITOR
;;   - The value of the environment variable EDITOR
;;   - Ask user
;;
;; The editor may be called in one of the following way:
;;
;;   EDITOR filename
;;   EDITOR +lineno filename
;;
;; The latter expects to locate the cursor on the specified line in the
;; filename.
;;
;; The file to open is determined by a generic function ed-pick-file.
;; It should return (<filename> <lineno>), or #f to indicate that it
;; couldn't determine the file to edit.
;;
;; NB: Common Lisp's ed can be invoked without argument.  For our usage,
;; though, that feature doesn't seem too useful---it's more likely that
;; repl IS inside an editor so we only need to open a specific file in
;; a buffer.  Emacsclient requires filename, so it further complicates things.
;; For now we just require one argument.
