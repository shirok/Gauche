;; procedure.  Instead, this returns three procedures and
;; one <line-edit-context> object. three procedures are one for 'read',
;; one for 'read-line', and another for skipping trailing whitespaces.
;  They are suitable to be passed to make-repl-reader.
;; NB: Currently we assume we use default console.  Might be useful
;; to allow other console (e.g. over pty).
