;;   buffered until it consists a valid S-expression.  The output
;;   is directly sent to the output port.  It's enough to handle
;;   usual situation.
;;
;;   A possible variant of <listener> is a double-buffered listener,
;;   that buffers output as well, which will be sent to the output
;;   port whenever it is ready.

;; Returns a thunk which should be called whenever input is
;; available.

;; Error handling is rather convoluted, for we have to deal with
;; a few different cases:
;;
;;  - I/O errors with reading/writing the client is regarded a
;;    fatal error.  The fatal-handler is called if the listener
;;    has any.  If the fatal-handler returns #f or the listener
;;    doesn't have one, the finalizer is called.  Usually these
;;    handlers removes listener to be called again.
;;
;;  - Errors during fatal handler or finalizer are "passed through"
;;    to the caller of the listener handler.  Usually it has a
;;    fatal consequence.  The fatal-handler and finalizer should
;;    be written so that foreseeable errors are properly handled
;;    within them.
;;
;;  - Other errors (e.g. read error while reading provided S-expr,
;;    or evaluation error) are handled by listener's error-handler.
;;    Double fault is regarded as a fatal error.
