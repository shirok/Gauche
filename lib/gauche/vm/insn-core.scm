;; This module isn't for public use.  Programs that wants to access
;; vm instruction info should use the gauche.vm.insn module, which
;; re-exports <vm-insn-info>.
;;
;; The reason that this is separated is solely for the 'geninsn' script,
;; which reads the VM definition and generates insn.scm.  Since
;; gauche.vm.insn module is generated by geninsn, it can't use gauche.vm.insn!
