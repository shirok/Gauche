;; 'propagate' slot option sends get/set request to other object.
;; The idea is taken from STk's "composite metaclass".
;;
;; The slot must have ':propagated' allocation, and ':propagate' option.
;; ':Propagate' option may be a symbol or a list of two elements.
;; Suppose the slot foo is a propagated slot.  If a symbol bar is given
;; to the :propagate option, reading of the slot returns
;; (slot-ref (slot-ref obj 'bar) 'foo), and writing to the slot causes
;; (slot-set! (slot-ref obj 'bar) 'foo value).  If a list (bar baz)
;; is given, baz is used as the actual slot name instead of foo.
