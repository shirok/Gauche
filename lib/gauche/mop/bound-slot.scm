;; EXPERIMENTAL: This is a helper class to catch trivial mistakes
;; that some slots are inadvertently left uninitialized---it can happen
;; when you update class definition but forget to change one of 'make'
;; calls, or misspelled initialization keyword arguments, etc.
;; The question is whether we should provide such a feature through
;; mixin class---it doesn't really add any new feature to the class,
;; so it seems out-of-place in the superclass list in the class definition.
;; Some sort of annotation or declaration would fit the bill, probably.
