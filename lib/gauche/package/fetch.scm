;; *EXPERIMENTAL*
;; gauche.package.fetch module is intended to automate fetching package
;; distribution from the Net.
;;
;; Eventually this module should take care of fetching a list of
;; available packages, and maintaining downloaded package cache.
;; For now, what this does is just to download tarball from the net
;; if it is specified by http or ftp url.
