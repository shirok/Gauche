;; Type handling
;;

;; Stub's type system doesn't exactly match Scheme's, since stub has
;; to handle internal guts of Scheme implementations as well as
;; C type systems.  We call the types used in the stub generator
;; "stub type", apart from "C type" and "Scheme type".
;;
;; For each existing conversion between C type and Scheme type, a stub
;; type is defined.  For types that has one-to-one mapping between
;; C and Scheme (such as most aggregate types, for example, Scheme's
;; <u32vector> and C's ScmU32Vector*), there is only one stub type,
;; which uses the same name as the Scheme's.  There are some stub types
;; that reflects C type variations: <int>, <int8>, <int16>, <int32>,
;; <uint>, <uint8>, <uint16>, <uint32> --- these are mapped to Scheme's
;; integer, but the range limit is taken into account.   <fixnum>
;; refers to the integers that can be represented in an immediate integer.
;; Note that a stub type <integer> corresponds to Scheme's exact integers,
;; but it is mapped to C's ScmObj, since C's integer isn't enough to
;; represent all of Scheme integers.   A stub type <void> is
;; used to denote a procedure return type.
;;
;; Each stub type has a "boxer" and an "unboxer".  A boxer is a C name
;; of a function or a macro that takes an object of C type of the stub
;; type and returns a Scheme object.  An unboxer is a C name of a function
;; or a macro that takes Scheme object and checks its vailidy, then
;; returns a C object of the C type or throws an error.
;;
;; Here's a summary of primitive stub types and the mapping each one
;; represents.
