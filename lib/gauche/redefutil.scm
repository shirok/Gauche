;; By default, the following slots of the new class are carried over:
;;  - it is instance allocated.
;;  - its allocation is either class or each-subclass, without having
;;    the default value.
;;  - it is a builtin slot and settable in the new class.
;;
;; If you want to carry over other slots, the first thing you'd want
;; to try is to customize change-class method.  Save the old slots before
;; calling next-method and set the new slots afterwards.  It can also be
;; used to carry over a value when the name of the slot is changed.
;; If you want to prevent some slots from being carried over by the
;; base change-class method, you can override
;; change-object-class-carry-over-slot? method to do so.
