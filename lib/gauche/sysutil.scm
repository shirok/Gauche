;; These are spilled out from src/libsys.scm, because we need
;; to expand cond-expand form on the running machine.
;; Src/libsys.scm is pre-compiled at the time of distribution,
;; so we cannot have platform-dependent cond-expand in it.

;; These are better to be in src/scmlib.scm, but right now we don't have
;; a nice way to make cond-expand work (when compiling src/scmlib.scm
;; cond-expand uses the host gosh's feature set, not the target gosh's.)
