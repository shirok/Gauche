;;; Defines a few procedures that deal with popular version
;;; numbers, such as 1.2.3.
;;;
;;; <version>    := <principal-release>
;;;              |  <version> <post-subrelease>
;;;              |  <version> <pre-subrelease>
;;; <principal-release> := <relnum>
;;; <post-subrelease>   := [.-] <relnum>
;;; <pre-subrelease>    := _ <relnum>
;;; <relnum>       := [0-9A-Za-z]+
;;;
;;; Typically <relnum> is composed by numeric part and extension part.
;;; For example, "23a" is composed by an integer 23 and extension "a".
;;; If relnum is entirely composed by an extension, we assume its
;;; numeric part is -1.
;;;
;;; Relnum ordering rule:
;;;   1. If relnum A and relnum B have different numeric part, we ignore the
;;;      extension and order them numerically, e.g.  "3b" < "4a"
;;;   2. If relnum A and relnum B have the same numeric part, we compare
;;;      extension by alphabetically, e.g.  "4c" < "4d" and "5" < "5a"
;;;
;;; Version ordering rule
;;;   1. Decompose each version into a list of <principal-release> and
;;;      subsequence subrelease components.   We call each element of
;;;      the list "release components".
;;;   2. If the first release component of both lists are the same,
;;;      remove it from both.  Repeat this until the head of the lists
;;;      differ.
;;;   3. Now we have the following cases.
;;;     (1) Both lists are empty: versions are the same.
;;;     (2) One list (A) is empty and the other list (B) has post-subrelease
;;;         at head: A is prior to B
;;;     (3) One list (A) is empty and the other list (B) has pre-subrelease
;;;         at head: B is prior to A
;;;     (4) List A's head is post-subrelease and list B's head is
;;;         pre-subrelease: B is prior to A
;;;     (5) Both lists have post-subrelease or pre-subrelease at head:
;;;         compare their relnums.
;;;
;;; Examples:
;;;    "1" < "1.0" < "1.1" < "1.1.1" < "1.1.2" < "1.2" < "1.11"
;;;    "1.2.3" < "1.2.3-1" < "1.2.4"
;;;    "1.2.3" < "1.2.3a" < "1.2.3b"
;;;    "1.2_rc0" < "1.2_rc1" < "1.2" < "1.2-pl1" < "1.2-pl2"
;;;    "1.1-patch112" < "1.2_alpha"
