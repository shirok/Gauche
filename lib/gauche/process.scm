;;
;;  * FD, FD0 and FD1 are nonnegative integers refer to the file

;;     a string - SOURCE names a file.  It is opened for reading and the child
;;                process can reads the file from FD.
;;     a symbol - A unidirectional pipe is created, whose 'reader' end
;;                is connected to the child's FD, and whose 'writer' end

;;     :null    - The child's FD is connected to the null device.
;;     an integer - It should specify a parent's file descriptor opened for
;;                input.  The child sees the duped file descriptor as FD.
;;     a file input port - The underlying file descriptor is duped into FD
;;                in the child process.
;;  * SINK can be either one of the followings:
;;     a string - Names a file.  It is opened for reading and the child process
;;                can writes to it via FD.
;;     a symbol - A unidirectional pipe is created, whose 'writer' end is
;;                connected to the child's FD, and whose 'reader' end is

;;  are a shorthand notation for (< 0 source), (> 1 sink) and (> 2 sink).
;;  furthermore, source and sink in these arguments can be :pipe, which

;;  respectively.
