;; In Gauche, string bodies are immutable and we just use an extra
;; indirection to realize mutable strings.  So it is trivial to
;; implement size-changing mutation, but it doesn't give you
;; any performance advantage---the cost of string-append! and string-replace!
;; are the same as string-append and string-replace, respectively.
;; We include srfi-118 for the portability.
