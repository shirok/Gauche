SRFI-159 is '(chibi show)' library from chibi scheme. Imported from
commit 5c43ca77 (move the col+ansi test to color section, 2019-11-07).

The library is restructured to become (srfi 159) (or (scheme
show)). This is mostly about sld changes:

chibi/show.sld          becomes srfi-159/util.sld (internal)
chibi/show/base.sld     becomes srfi-159/inner-base.sld (internal)
chibi/show/color.sld    becomes srfi-159/color.sld
chibi/show/column.sld   becomes srfi-159/columnar.sld
chibi/show/unicode.sld  becomes srfi-159/unicode.sld
util and inner-base     make    srfi-159/base.sld

Most libraries include inner-base to have access to some procedures
that are not visible from (srfi 159 base). columnar not only needs
inner-base but also util.

All .scm files keep their names from chibi (e.g. util library includes
show.scm).
