Gauche is a Scheme scripting engine aiming at being a handy tool that helps
programmers and system administrators to write small to large scripts quickly.

Visit the project webpage http://practical-scheme.net/gauche/ for more details.

If you're new to this project and want to try compiling from git repo, 
check HACKING first.  If it is your first time to build Gauche, you should
start from the release tarball instead of git clone; see
http://practical-scheme.net/gauche/download.html on how to get the tarball.
Once you get and untar the release tarball, see INSTALL in it for the instructions.
